# Vehicle-Detection-Tracking-Python
In this project, we utilized YOLOv8 for detecting vehicles and counting them. Additionally, we implemented a real-time tracking algorithm for 2D multiple object tracking in video sequences using the repository found at https://github.com/abewley/sort. 

I found that YOLOv8 was an effective tool for detecting vehicles in various settings. I was able to accurately count the number of vehicles passing through a given area, which is useful for traffic analysis and management. 

To further enhance our project, we incorporated the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm from the aforementioned repository. This allowed us to track multiple objects in real-time, which is particularly useful for monitoring traffic flow and identifying potential safety hazards. 

Overall, our project demonstrates the effectiveness of YOLOv8 and the SORT algorithm for vehicle detection, counting, and tracking.
